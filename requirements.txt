NLP Class Projects (Team of 3–4 Students)

OVERVIEW:
This document provides step-by-step instructions for the NLP class project. Students must work in teams of 3–4 and follow all steps carefully. The final project should be professional, well-documented, and suitable for GitHub submission.

STEP 1 — MAKE A GROUP:


STEP 2 — UNDERSTAND THE DATA SOURCE:
• Use only ONE PDF document: UET Prospectus.
• The chatbot must answer ONLY department-related questions.
• If a user asks anything else, the chatbot must reply: "I only answer department information."

STEP 3 — DRAW THE ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM (Before Coding):
Create a simple architecture diagram showing the following components or additional based on your architecture:
1. PDF → Preprocessing
2. Data Storage (Vector Database / Graph / Knowledge Base)
3. Retriever (find relevant text)
4. LLM (gemma3 via Ollama or vLLM)
5. Guardrail (check if the question is department-related)
6. API Layer (FastAPI)
7. GUI (Chat Interface)
You may use draw.io or any similar diagramming tool.

STEP 4 — DIVIDE TASKS (Team Responsibilities):
Create a simple task division plan, for example:
• Person 1: PDF reading, cleaning, and chunking
• Person 2: RAG / Graph / Agent logic
• Person 3: Backend API development (FastAPI)
• Person 4: GUI development, testing, and video recording

STEP 5 — BUILD REST API:
Develop the backend using FastAPI.
Required endpoint:
• POST /chat → Takes user message and returns an answer with citations.

STEP 6 — BUILD GUI CHATBOT:
Create a simple chat interface using one of the following:
• Streamlit
• Gradio
• React etc.
The GUI must display:
• User messages
• Chatbot responses

STEP 7 — ORGANIZE YOUR PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE:
Your repository must include:
• requirements.txt
• README.md
• Proper folder structure
• Architecture diagram file

Recommended folder structure:
backend/
frontend/
data/
diagrams/
tests/
requirements.txt
README.md

STEP 8 — TESTING:
Prepare at least 20 test questions:
• 10 department-related questions
• 5 tricky questions
• 5 out-of-scope questions
Test the system and save them in:
tests/test_queries.json

STEP 9 — RECORD VIDEO AND PRESENTATION:
Record a 6–10 minute video covering:
1. Architecture diagram explanation
2. Team task division
3. Live demo with 3 questions:
   - Department-related question
   - Tricky question
   - Out-of-scope question
4. Project repository structure
Add the video link to the README.md file.
